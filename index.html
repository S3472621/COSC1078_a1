    <ul><li>My name is Haidar Alkhalkhali, my student ID is S3472621 and my RMIT email is <a href="mailto:S3472621@student.rmit.edu.au">S3472621@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.<li>I am the son of Iraqi parents who migrated to Australia in 2000 after fleeing the gulf war.</li>
    <li>I am fluent in Arabic and English and possess a BSC in Biomedical Science.</li>
    <li>My interests include Anime, heavy metal music, football and the love of all information others deem irrelevant.</li>
    <li>A shisha Aficionado at heart, I believe a good day includes a football match, several episodes of anime and a good apple-mint shisha to end my day.</li>
    <h1 id="interest" class=headings>Interest In IT</h1></ul>

    <p>From a young age, I have been fascinated by the wonders of IT. Early on in my adolescent years I delved into the digital world of interconnectivity and discovered a vast cache of music, movies, games, and other bountiful treasures there for the taking. Though I didn’t fathom the process of how it all worked, I understood that what I was enjoying was the product of countless individuals working hand in hand over the years to make it possible.</p>

    <p>My interest peaked when I acquired my first iPod touch on release day and discovered a product I never knew I needed until that day. Though limited at first to merely being a glorified iPod pro, relegated to accessing music, videos and the occasional web browsing, I soon discovered its true potential via the process known as jailbreaking. This process, whilst somewhat taboo at the time, enabled the ability of sideloading cydia; an app forever enshrined in my memory. It was what sparked my interest in IT as it required the use of terminal to SSH into the root files and unlock my companion’s true potential. It led me down a path to discovering a community of internet entrepreneurs who collectively shaped my high school life as that of digital discovery.</p>

    <p>Whilst I never took the plunge to pursue IT professionally, I was always fascinated by the prospect of what the future in IT would entail.</p>

    <p>Though I studied Biomedicine throughout my college years, I always believed IT was the one that got away.</p>

    <p>Now, after running a somewhat autonomous online business for several years, I finally have time to explore my passion and reclaim the career I envisioned myself back when I first purchased my original iPod touch. I can see the potential to grow in a field undeniable dominate over most industries today and its ever-evolving nature terrifies and excites every aspect of my existence. Everything in the world is built upon a solid foundation of code, whether it be simple tasks as home automation to self-sufficient autonomous vehicles like the Mars rover, and it is my mission to understand as much of it as possible during the next phase of my life. RMIT’s reputation as world leading institute will hopefully catapult me into the trajectory, I envisioned for myself in early adolescent years.</p>

    <h1 id="ideal" class=headings>Ideal Job</h1>

    <img src="images/job listing.JPG" alt="machine learning job listing">

    <p>Machine learning and the power to use algorithms to empower society and unlock the potential for human-ai optimising is an opportunity I cannot pass up.

    A strong coding foundation is a must in this field and this position will allow me to utilise my soon to be acquired knowledge in the IT sector to find solutions to problems for the betterment of society. Via the use of python, SQL and machine learning, this role would allow me to grow my abilities in the field of my choosing and prepare me for future tasks where such knowledge is required.

    Whilst I possess the communication and stakeholder management skills required, my lack of experience in Python and SQL which are currently rudimentary at best is the hurdle I need to overcome to obtain this role. Without a doubt, within the next few years, this will be a thing of the past. The current subjects I am enrolled in; Introduction to Computer Systems, Information Technology, Programming and Practical Database Concepts are all providing me with exact foundation I require to pursue this career in the years to come.

    Machine learning and DevOps experience are also required in this position as they are definitely an attribute of IT I believe to be standouts in the field. They are essential in corporate and creative sectors where scaling of operations is a factor and MLOps is integral to that process.

    My current plan of action is to focus on the subjects outlined above in the immediate future along with future subjects set by my curriculum. Those, alongside informational videos, Stem learning programs and other resources widely available online will allow me to get certified in Java, SQL and python along with other necessary utilities and skills such as MLOps which I will require.</p>

    <h2 class=headings>Debater</h2>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <h4>ENTP-A / ENTP-T</h4>

    <img src="images/profile ent-a.JPG" alt="ent-a">

    <h4>Dissection</h4>
    <p>As an individual with a Debater personality, I refuse to accept the status quo and attempt to identify with situations on a more personal and intimate level rather than conform to the norm. Though it may lead to possible hostilities, it empowers my sense of individuality and allows me to portray my point of view without reservations. To me, this is an essential attribute which distinguishes me amongst my peers in a positive way.</p>

    <p>Strengths associated with this personality include being knowledgeable, original, quick thinking, possessing brainstorming prowess, originality, and a highly energetic persona.</p>

    <p>These attributes accentuate my uniqueness and drive to stand out which is essential when progressing to leadership roles in professional environments. To grow in any field, one needs to display attributes which make them fit for the role and there is no better way to prove this then to display your confidence in your own abilities individually and in collaborative environments. When involved in team exercises, the attributes of this personality manifest in ones need to take charge and lead a group to its true potential.</p>

    <p>Weaknesses identified by the profile include being very argumentative, Insensitive, Intolerant, difficulty focusing and a dislike of practical matters.</p>

    <p>The word weaknesses might sound intimidating to some, however, to an assertive individual with this profile they are simply subjective attributes to be debated. To be dominant in a professional work environment; an individual needs to use every skill in their arsenal, including those which others may classify as weaknesses. Thus, to ensure a positive outcome in group situations, an induvial must ensure they are always prepared for the task at hand. This ensures that should conflict arise, one is able to provide evidence to persuade others to confirm to one’s leadership and guidance. </p>

    <h2 class=headings>Learning Style test</h2>

    <p>http://www.educationplanner.org/</p>

    <h3>Your scores:</h3>
    <h4>Auditory: 25%</h4>
    <h4>Visual: 40%</h4>
    <h4>Tactile: 35%</h4>

    <h5>You are a Visual learner!</h5>

    <h4>Dissection</h4>
    <p>As a visual learner, I am an individual who learns and understands more when visual receptors are activated. In any given field, I am more interested in physically observing processes and processing information I can see and read rather than listen to instructions and orders provided by others. Witnessing a task once is usually enough for me to understand a process and enhances my ability to repeat tasks in a certain environment. This can be in the form of coding, writing reports or instructing others on task at hand.</p>

    <p>My low auditory predilection enforces the personal stigma I assign myself in my weakened ability to concentrate in conversations or instructions I deem less interesting. Whilst this is a deficit, it means I need to focus more on enhancing my active listening to mitigate any short comings I may experience professionally.</p>

    <p>In collaborative environments, this predisposition sways me to discuss, and debate matters with my pears rather than simply taking turns speaking or working individually. For optimum results I often seek out other like-minded individuals who are also assertive and vocal about their views rather than simply conformists as debate often produces the best outcomes.</p>

    <h2 class=headings>Logical Reasoning Test</h2>

    <p class>https://www.123test.com/logical-reasoning-test/</p>

    <img src="images/logical reasoning test.JPG" alt="test b">

    <p>A logic-based test displays an individual’s ability to find logical solutions based on patterns and reasoning skills. </p>

    <p>Upon completion of the task, I achieved a result of 7 out of 10 which provided some insights about both logical reasoning skills and my personality io general. The answers which appeared incorrect are 3 of the final 4 questions, which suggests that an aspect which contributed to the results was my impatience in the final few questions. </p>

    <p>Another aspect is the test provided some insight into my ability to distinguish patterns correctly. In most cases I was able to find said pattern by looking at the image, however, where it was necessary to divide an image into its part components, my reasoning skills appeared to be lacking at times.</p>

    <p>Logical reasoning is important in any field and more practice in such tests would increase the probability of achieving higher test results, however the results are not what is important. They simply display not only one’s intelligence but rather an individuals’ ability to see logic when confronted with it. This is especially important for individuals with a predisposition to debate and argue such as myself when in a collaborative environment. A lack of ability to see logic can have a detrimental effect on group situations where one’s ability for persuasion is stronger than their ability to logically understand a topic. It can include situation where one would continue to argue an incorrect position even if the more logical argument is presented resulting in a negative outcome.</p>

    <h1 id="project">Project Idea</h1>

    <h2 class=headings>Overview</h2>

    <p>The project I envision is an online platform by the name of shisha base. It revolves around the idea of a crowdsourced shisha review and recommendation platform based on machine learning. The front end will be user facing, which will allow individuals to rate shisha flavours and shisha products based on personal experience. A database is then integrated into the back end which collates data input from the online community while separating different products based on constituent ingredients, product code, brand, potency, and other variables. Machine learning coded into the backend will then recommend future products to members based on the products they have rated.</p>

    <h2 class=headings>Motivation</h2>

    <p>A motivating factor for this project was my personal experience in searching for a favourable shisha flavour outside the mainstream products. For several years my options were limited to only that which was tried and tested, my trusted apple-mint by the brand Al-Fakher. Whilst occasionally an endeavour was initiated to try other flavours, a repeated lack of success in finding a solution led me gave up on my quest. This was mainly due to lack of access to information available online as site recommendations often turned out to be completely contrary to what reviews stated. This is mainly because flavour websites often recommend products based on commercial viability rather than a customer’s tailored taste. </p>

    <p>This all changed upon the discovery of a reddit thread where a group of like-minded individuals presented me with their recommendations. Niche flavours which surprising turned out to be the highlight of my shisha experience thus far. This was the time a decision was made for the creation of the virtual platform shisha base. A haven for likeminded shisha aficionados to explore and experiment with options they never knew existed. </p>

    <h2 class=headings>Description</h2>

    <p>The project at hand would require the coding of a front-end user-based review system to build a database of flavours, constituent ingredients, brand, and aggregate rating. Customers will create a profile and begin a journey of discovery. They will select their set-up by choosing from existing products such as shisha bases, heads, accessories, and flavours. </p>

    <p>When a user’s product is not available in our database, they have the option of adding said product which is then reviewed and accepted into our database for future users.</p>

    <p>The rating system will be implemented to identify favourability of not only retail products but also the constituent ingredients. This system will be a 0-10 based system, where 10 is highly favourable and 0 very unfavourable.</p>

    <p>Machine learning is used to determine likelihood of a user liking a product based on ratings of other products as well as commonality amongst their peers.</p>

    <p>Example 1;</p>

    <p> User A likes flavours: Love66, Angel Lips, Punk Man and Blue orange.</p>
    <p> User B likes flavours: Love66, Punk Man, Blue Orange and 3 Angels</p>
    <p> Shisha Base proceeds to recommend 3 Angels to User A and Angel Lips to User B.</p>


    <p>Also possible is the mixing of certain products to create new and potentially favourable flavours.</p>

    <p>Example 2;</p>

    <p>Multiple users rate Flavours A & B highly. Correlation between users liking Flavour A if they like flavour B and vice-versa is found.</p>

    <p> Flavour A: Love66 (passion fruit, honeydew melon, tropical passion fruit, mint)</p>

    <p> Flavour B: Lady Killer: (melon, mango, and berry)</p>

    <p> Shisha Base will recommend the option of mixing Flavours A + B to create new flavour.</p>

    <p>A weekly automated data analysis in the back end will be published which shows most liked flavours weekly and newly discovered mixes with highest performing attributes published on the front page.</p>

    <p>A tailored recommendation list will also be published for each individual user on their home page. The rankings of the recommendations are to be based on their ratings + other individuals rating of products based on similar likes and dislikes. </p>

    <p>A social aspect of the project will include a section where users can discuss products, set-ups, and other relevant products. This will produce a collaborative space for users to discuss experiences and ideas in an open forum where flow of information will enable others to learn from each other freely and intuitively.</p>

    <p>A specialised section where manufacturers and users can interact will also allow feedback to be more easily accessible and enhance the flow of information from both sides.</p>

    <h2 class=headings>Tools and Technologies </h2>

    <p>The main investment this project would require would be skilled man hours into developing the code for the project. Physical storage is unnecessary as the project would utilise AWS service for cloud computing and storage.</li>

    <ul><li>AWS</li>
    <li>This manages the Ec2 instance, Loadbalancer, auto scaling, backups, database</li>
    <li>Machine Learning Model Hosting</li>
    <li>Languages – Java, javascript, mysql, HTML, CSS</li>
    <li>Frameworks – reactJs, Springboot</li>
    <li>Database – RDBMS</li>
    <li>CICD – CircleCi</li>
    <li>Docker</li></ul>


    <h2 class=headings>Skills Required </h2>

    <p>DevOps skill are required for the deployment of the application. Their needs to be a publicly accessible front end which has an internal connection to the backend. Furthermore, the backend should have direct connections to the database and machine learning mode. The correcting security group rules must be put into place as well as the correct deployment method. </p>
    <p>GitHub skill is essential in the implementation of a stable project. The correct method of branching should be used such as git flow to ensure the best practises are being applied and no untested code is put into production.</p>
